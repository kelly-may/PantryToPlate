Pantry to Plate is a program that is here to help you make delicious recipes with what
is already available in your kitchen. Build an inventory of the food in your kitchen, 
and add your favorite recipes to the Cook Book. Pantry to Plate will show you recipes
that use only food found in your inventory. 

By using Pantry To Plate, you can save time, money and food by not having to travel to 
the grocery store as often, and by using up the food that is already in your kitchen.
This not only is good for your wallet, but is good for the Earth too.
